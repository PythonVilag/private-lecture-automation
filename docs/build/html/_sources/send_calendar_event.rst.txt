Send Calendar Event
===================

Upon request the script sends out an email containing the calendar event of the next lecture for the client.


Setting up student data
-----------------------

For the script an json object must be prepared that is used to contain information about the students.
This file must be located at ```data/students.json``.

The file is structured as follows:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "Arany Barna": {
            "name": "Arany Barna",  // The name of the student
            "email": "aranyb@gmail.com",  // The email address of the student
            "content_link": "https://www.pythonvilag.hu",  // The link to where lesson specific content can be found (usually a Google Drive folder)
            "day": "2",  // The day of the week when the lecture takes place (0: Monday, 1: Tuesday, ..., 6: Sunday)
            "time": "1630",  // The time of the lecture in the format HHMM
            "duration": "90",  // The duration of the lecture in minutes
            "occasion_number": "3"  // The number of the next lecture
        },
    }


Using Send Calendar Event
-------------------------

A simple example of using the `send_calendar_event` functionality:

.. code-block:: python

    from private_lecture_automation import send_calendar_event

    send_calendar_event(
        student_name="Arany Barna",  # The name of the student, must match the key in the json file
        **kwargs: {"time": "1700"}  # For temporal changes the content of the json file can be overwritten
    )
